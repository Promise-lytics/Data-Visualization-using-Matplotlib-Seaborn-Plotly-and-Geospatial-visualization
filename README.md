# Data-Visualization-using-Matplotlib-Seaborn-Plotly-and-Geospatial-visualization
This project was done with the diabetes dataset in a view to compare visualization techniques using Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly.
The dataset contains information on 768 patients with diabetes, including their age, gender, body mass index, blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements.

The goal of this project was to compare the different visualization techniques and to determine which one is the most effective for visualizing the data.

The results of the comparison showed that Plotly was the most effective for visualizing the data. Plotly was able to create interactive and dynamic visualizations that allowed for easy exploration of the data. Additionally, Plotly was able to create more aesthetically pleasing visualizations than the other two techniques.
